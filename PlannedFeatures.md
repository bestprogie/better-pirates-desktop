# Planned Features #

These are the features that are currently planned for Better Pirates Desktop and their current status.

## Blueprint Tracker ##
  * **In Progress**
    * Individual buttons for each level of salvage/elite salvage/raid target so users don't have muddle about with combo boxes (may not be practical, given the number of bp-dropping targets but we'll see).
    * The ability to keep track of drop rate and streaks for each tier.
    * The ability to specify exactly which piece you've found when you find it.
    * The ability to track all of your completed and in-progress blueprints so you know what you had at any given time.
  * **Planned**
    * The ability to take and store screenshots of each find to use as evidence in the event you lose a print.
    * The ability to go back and edit history in the event you accidentally mis-click something.
    * Support for multiple BP accounts so that multiple people sharing a computer can all use the tool.
  * **If There's Time**
    * The ability to view all available blueprints, whether completed or not, and see the build costs for planning purposes.
    * The ability to combine results from multiple users across multiple installations into a central database on the web to create a more statistically significant sample size and results.
